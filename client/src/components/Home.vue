    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Our objective is to give students a broad security background. We give weekly lectures on a wide range of topics, and run a semester long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security">Capture the Flag competition</a> to train anyone interested.</p>
    <p>No security background is necessary to participate! However, completion of CS1 or a high familiarity with computers will be very helpful. Most of our meetings stand independently, and we will announce when a topic builds on another and requires extra experience.</p>
    <h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>
    <p>Fall 2018 meetings will be held every Tuesday 7PM to 10PM in Union 3510 + 3511. We'll try to arrive a little early, so feel free to stop by before the meeting starts if you have any questions or just want to chat!</p>
    <p>Each meeting we give a small lecture on a specific topic (ie Web Hacking, Cryptography, or Packet Sniffing), hold a discussion on recent events in the security community, and then work together on security challenges.</p>
    <h2 id="mailing-list">Mailing list</h2>
    <p>The Introsec mailing list is low volume (usually one message a week) and is used to announce:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="row">
        <p>The topic of the next meeting</p>
      </li>
      <li class="row">
        <p>Upcoming CTFs that RPISEC or Introsec will be competing in</p>
      </li>
      <li class="row">
        <p>Major events in the security community</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To join the mailing list, register an account on this website.</p>
    <h2 id="important-tools">Important tools</h2>
    <p>We will go over any specific tools necessary for each topic, but we also provide links to common tools for reference on our <a href="/tools">tools page.</a></p>

    <h2 id="how-do-i-join">How do I join?</h2>
    <p>First, register an account on this website. An account will give you access to our online CTF and will put you on our announcement mailing list. If you do not get a weekly announcement email, write to us by email or on IRC - we probably forgot to check for new accounts.</p>
    <p>Next, show up! We hold meetings once a week, and will be happy to help you catch up after the lecture if you missed the first few weeks.</p>
