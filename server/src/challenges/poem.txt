we struggle to have meaning                                                                                                      
in this world which we all know                                                                                                            
we try but yet we wonder                                                                                                 
where we all should go                                                                                                       
hidden in the questions                                                                                                                           
which we can not find                                                   
the answers are all hidden                                                                                                              
deep inside our minds                                                                                                    
hidden in our soul                                                                                               
is the life we try to hide                                                
but in time it will find you                                                                                                      
and it will release                                                                                               
all of its secrets hidden beneath                                                                                                                    
so before it ruins the life you have made                                                                                                        
release those dark secrets                                                   
and the memories will fade                                                                                               
hidden in our lives are stories left untold                                                                                                            
of the things we didn't want them to know                                                 
but once you tell somebody                                                                                                              
and make your feelings known                                                   
the struggle will be over
